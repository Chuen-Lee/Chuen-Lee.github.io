High stepping through the muddy grounds of desire.  
Turning right into bush’s concealed smoke cloud.  
As the young around me go rogue, chuckling.  
  
Vividly dreaming on the deranged commute.  
Waking up to the laughter of the illiterate.  
As they reveal a puff of gas, releasing.  
  
“Men, men and their testosterone”  
Seeking destruction and mayhem  
Reminiscent of a mutated Banner  
  
“SMASH!”  
  
Lightly skipping over the flower bed  
Breezing onto the scent of after-shave.  
As the foetus within me go “boff”, kicking.  
  
Warm caring throughout the sky-high cruise.  
Transient silence. In short supply of restlessness.  
Reproduced as blown glass by contemporary artists.
