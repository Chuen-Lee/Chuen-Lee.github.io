#Counting beetles made easy with TriCount

Check out the app at: https://chuen-lee-tricount-scriptstrilit-37hlb0.streamlit.app/

Upload an image.

Adjust the options to find suitable values for your purposes.

##A few tips

1. Use images taken from the same height (object should be similar size) and lighting (avoid shadows).
2. Adjust "Size of beetles" first to find a reasonable count. Then, alter "Distance between beetles" to find the best reading.
3. If both steps 1 and 2 were followed but still not working, go to "Advanced Options", try changing "Threshold".
4. If all above fails, reach out to me.
